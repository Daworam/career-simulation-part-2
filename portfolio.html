      <section id="port1" class="content-box">
        <p>
          My first personal project that I created using HTML and CSS. I chose the topic of Greece because I have always wanted to visit Greece, and have even thought of moving there to live for a time because I love the rich history and scenic landscapes of the country.

      <section id="port2" class="content-box">
        <p>
          My second personal project utilized Flex in CSS to position some of the elements on the page. This was also created using HTML and CSS. I have always been interested in mythology from around the world and look forward to putting together a site that can house all of the stories that I love.

      <section id="port3" class="content-box">
        <p>
          The Study Guide site I created to both practice my skills in HTML and CSS, as well as catalogue all of the knowledge that I gain while taking the boot-camp through Fullstack Academy. As I compile everything I learn, I will go over the notes again and again all while using the skills I took notes about in the actual creation of the page!
