# Readme

The readme file for my first career simulation html/css web page

## Main Page

Included on the home page I have created a persistent Nav Bar that changes depending on what page the user is currently on. I used Flex to keep the name and the buttons on opposite sides of the nav bar. 

I have also included 3 sections to contain content, an image, and a quote. I also used Flex to position the image and the header on the same line and to center them vertically.

## About Me Page

On the About me page I have included 3 category sections, each with a header and a paragraph element to list and contain the content of each. I have also included some dividers. 

## Portfolio Page

On the Portfolio page I used Flex to pair the paragraph element and an image element inside of a content section so that they display side by side. I also included dividers and headers for each project. 

## Contact Me Page

Created a form that captures name, email, and a message from users. Submit button redirects to a 'Success' page on click.

### Other

*Added different sizing units to elements on the page
*Utilized more Flex formatting
*Formatted elements to be more readable on a mobile device using media query
*Included hover effects in the nav bar
*Created hover effects using transition
