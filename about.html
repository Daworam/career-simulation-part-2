          I enjoy many activities in my free time, when I'm not coding of
          course! Some of the things that I like to do in my down time are going
          to the gym and working out, watching TV shows, playing video games
          with my brother and friends, and exploring wherever I am. Lately in
          the gym I have been focusing on lifting weights and building my
          routine to match my long term goals. It is definitely a process but I
          love taking care of myself and maintaining my health through fitness.
          Some TV shows that I have been watching recently are 'To Your
          Eternity' and 'Avatar: The Last Airbender' which recently came out in
          live action on Netflix. The video games that I am playing now are Call
          of Duty Modern Warfare 3, Battlefield 2042, and Epic Age (which is a
          phone game).

        <h2 class="content-header">Career History</h2>
        <p class="content-box">
          I have worked many different jobs in my career history, the most
          recent being the Student Records Coordinator for the Irving Universal
          Technical Institute Campus. Before that I was working as a Court
          Judicial Assistant in the Criminal Unit of Fort Collins' Count and
          District Courts. The job I loved the most so far was working as a
          Teaching Assistant / Administrative assistant to the Director for
          Sierra School of Thompson, which was a Special Education School for
          kids with social and emotional disabilities. However, with all of that
          experience behind me, I am looking forward to learning the skills to
          start a career in Web Development and Software Engineering.

        <p class="content-box">
          I grew up in Kingwood, Texas with my identical twin brother. We have a
          very loving set of parents who convinced us to move from Kingwood to
          Fort Collins, Colorado. We lived in Colorado for almost eight years
          before our parents once again convinced us to follow them back to
          Texas, where we ended up in Dallas, Texas. I get to see my parents
          frequently, and I talk to my brother almost every day when we play
          video games together with our friends at the ends of most nights.
